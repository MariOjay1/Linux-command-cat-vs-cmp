# Linux-command-cat-vs-cmp
This project documents my practice using qwik lab to explore fundamental  Linux file integrity commands. I learnt how to: compute file hashes with sha256sum to verify data integrity,display stored hashes using the cat command for easy inspection,compare hashes with the cmp command to detect differences between files.
